Starlight Express is amazing and is really interesting because when and while all of the which are all the characters are skating they are singing and dancing at the same time while they are skating.
Starlight Express is interesting. For each production it is really big when they do it at the theaters has to be a lot and enough space for them. Because they have to skate. Because they skate a lot in Starlight Express. 
CATS The Musical 1998 is really good, and amazing.
